It was very intense because he remembers them very vividly. There was this group I used to work with called J*DaVeY, and they were a very electric group from Los Angeles and still very much so are. One time Kendrick opened up for them with this group Black Hippy [also featured rapper Schoolboy Q] and he remembers.

That whole 'we don't give a fuck thing'. They actually do give a fuck. They're creatively really forward-thinking, as a band there aren't a lot of existing bands in the limelight that are being considered like them. There's also the factor that my little brother [Jameel Bruner] is in the band but there's more than that. I've grown to know them personally each day creatively, and they all have their own minds and think differently. They work together very differently than from when they're by themselves, which shows a lot about them creatively, which I really appreciate. They have a lot to offer.

If I know Steven [Ellison, real name] a bit, I know that he's very straightforward and the thing that drives him is more or less the ups and downs and the ins and outs of what it is. What drives him to create music is exactly that – music. Nothing else. Not hype, not a cool moment or a 'good look'. It's not a cliché.

She's witty and dry, active in an electronic landscape where you're not coming for a thought process. You're coming to dance or vibe or be confronted with textures, and she does it all. She makes her own beats and samples. As an artist, her live performance is this incredible movement between a stand-up routine and a psychotic electronic lullaby. It's sexy, sexual and sensual and she speaks these lyrics about pleasure, confronting the fact that people can manipulate, and that she's also manipulative. It's the lyrics of Fiona Apple in the body of this alien who you imagine walks the Echo Park streets at night and takes the sound of Los Angeles then uses it in this Britney Spears seeing-pop-music via this third world Eastern Bloc mentality. It's an incredible exchange of currency, seeing our pop culture through the gaze of someone who can't even get to a pair of Levi's. She's not weighed down by what an American feminist would be.

There are so many people messing with modular synths but I'm blown away when I can get a feeling out of synthesized music that I could also get out of a soul record.

The dude has a whole separate house for his records! He said something to me that shook me because it's true. He said he wanted the record so bad because 20 years from now she might be one of the only artists that anybody remembers and I think that's true. There's so much great stuff happening now to get you through the day but there aren't enough people making their own worlds like Joanna. When you think of legacy artists that's what all those people had in common – doing things that they invented that not many people do, without borrowing from what's around.

He's done so much to just educate this community and bring everyone up in a way that I don't think anyone else does. So many people are guarded about their information and his openness draws me to him. I'm a DJ too and I see it all day, somebody's playing an insane track and they put their hand over the label if you come up to them, but if you ask Dem he'll write the catalogue number down so you can go out and find it! I think Funkmosphere is one of the great LA club nights. Even though he's very known for one sound and style he listens to everything. He'll be just as quick to talk about Prefab Sprout as he will the modern soul he's known for. That's what makes him a great musician. He's not stuffing the box in which he creates. He looks everywhere for inspiration. He's one of my favourite dudes to run into around town because he's always so ready to spread the word. In this world we live in where all information is available and everybody is moving backwards, copying stuff, it's hard to hear any new music that you can't just draw the direct lines to what influenced it. The way we're going to get out of that is to teach everybody about everything. I think he's one of the great warriors on that fight, his enthusiasm for discovery is so infectious.

She was able to do that because she spent her time developing her lyrics and subject matter from an independent place. It's the opposite of what you think of when you look at the stereotype of LA culture, which is always populace. She's local, not in terms of scope, but subject matter. She's also crystallized a style movement that's not just white hipsters, it's more about incorporating creatives from all walks of life. She works with a lot of LA producers, recording her album here, and she's brought a lot of credibility to the fabric of LA music.

She was part of a really exciting time surrounding a crew with the likes of Ariel Pink, and Geneva Jacuzzi; they were all performing shows in galleries. She was always balancing this world of art and pop music. Everything she continues to do today is conceptually-based so you always know there are deeper layers and ideas she's invoking uniquely through music. She's still able to present it all in a manner that has a pop sensibility, similar to the qualities you'll find in someone like Kate Bush or Laurie Anderson. She walks the line between improvised and very heavily composed music. She draws from both, and part of that is via the collaborative work she does which harks back to her CalArts days. I've seen her perform as part of very experimental performance art pieces in galleries with directors and film-makers. She's as comfortable there as she is in a traditional concert setting. I've known her for around 12 years and I recently saw her perform in North Carolina, she did a solo set in a church and she had the audience totally mesmerised.

The jungle had overtaken them, vines were coming in to the ceilings, it was very haunting. Sun Araw's music evokes that same haunted sensibility. Ithas a classic form but is very primal at the same time. I'd describe it as deep blues music, but also interplanetary, like Sun Ra – witchy and soulful. He plays guitars, keyboards and sings in this upfront, proclamation-like way. In LA, he's a facilitator. He's collaborated with a lot of artists and is always coming out with something new, something uniquely his vision. He's an incredible graphic designer and a filmmaker. He builds a world that feels seamless, and he does it on his own terms. His Duppy Gun project is one of the most interesting things coming out of LA. People don't consider Duppy Gun “LA music” because it's Jamaican music filtered through these experimental LA producers who make out-of-bounds dancehall music. Sun Araw practices the idea of collapsing borders, bringing creative voices together in an innovative way, and it's not virtual.

You'd never guess that he'd become so political, nor that he'd pioneer ratchet music with DJ Mustard, or re-invent G Funk for the modern era. His rap style might've been initially simplistic, but he always had charisma, a sense of humor, and an ability to connect. Even one of his early hits, 'I Need Weed'  might seem basic, but it resonated locally because this id California, where almost everyone needs weed.  'FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)' became an anthem for 2016 because the best way to fight a bully like Trump is just a simple pithy catchphrase. 'Fuck Donald Trump' is the sort of thing you could put on a bumper sticker or abbreviate for a hashtag (#FDT). He really came into his own on [2014 LP] 'My Krazy Life'. By that point he'd studied great rap albums and retained that inherent relatability. He's influenced everyone from skate kids to every local street rapper,  Drake to Iggy Azalea, etc. The only California rapper that's as influential in the last half decade is Kendrick.

If YG is the Snoop Dogg of this generation and DJ Mustard is Dr Dre, Vince Staples is its Ice Cube. He's hyper intelligent but has an emotional sensitivity. He grew up in Long Beach and Compton and absorbed a lot of different cultures, ranging from punk rock to mariachi music to Sublime to  Joy Division to Suga Free. He'd never call what he does 'art rap', but he's creating the sort of stuff that you'd imagine Andre 3000 would make if he was a 23-year old Crip from the North Side of Long Beach.  In the '90s everyone was trying to be like Dre – and his influence remains all-encompassing in LA. But slowly, people have stopped chasing that co-sign or what the industry demands. Vince is an example of someone who makes rap music that's what it wants to be, it doesn't need to be defined by labels or genre. Whatever the trend is he's not pandering to it. None of it matters. He doesn't give a fuck about what's cool, he just wants to be normal. There's a brilliance in that, and an importance in keeping low to the ground. He has a Bruce Springsteen kind of thing.

Until the release of 2015's The Epic, he lacked the clear statement of vision that seems clarion now.  Was there anything less cool than being a modern jazz player in the early 2000s? But Kamasi made that stigma seem ridiculous.  There was little opportunity to be a solo jazz star in that era. His ascendance is an extension of the influence of the Low End Theory and Brainfeeder world, this futuristic underground, a scene that's in line with London's Hyperdub. Kamasi didn't single-handedly make jazz cool. Madlib was his own one-man movement. Badbadnotgood built a wide fanbase too, and you can't forget guys like Robert Glasper and Terrace Martin. But Kamasi managed to put together all these different strands of music that have existed in LA for a long time together. He made people dance to jazz, he evolved the genre","quote":"\"He's an unmistakable hulking presence\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"Lucky Dragons","track":"","pickedBy":"Joshua Steinbeck","body":"They did the best thing I've seen this year. I don't remember the first time I came across them – probably a show at The Smell a decade ago. I've seen them in a few different ways over the years. It's performance art and music combined. This year Devendra Banhart curated a festival in Minneapolis and brought his favourite LA artists there, including Lucky Dragons. They wrote a piece for the show and it was so mindblowing. Sarah (Rara) was typing out stream of consciousness poetry, just words about what they were doing walking around in the day, and Luke (Fischbeck) was grabbing the type and turning it into sound, purely from Sarah typing out these words. It was beautiful sounding and everything she was typing was projected onto a screen. At the end he did a minute-long solo vocal and it was fantastic. It's the most moving thing I've seen this year. They just did a river walking performance too, walking along the LA River and everyone was singing chants about the different areas we were walking through. They're a perfect mixture of art and found ideas and it's very musical","quote":"\"They're the best thing I've seen this year\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"M Geddes Gengras","track":"","pickedBy":"Joshua Steinbeck","body":"I got turned onto this from Matthew “Matthewdavid” McQueen who runs Leaving Records. I listened to the record and thought it was lovely. I'd never seen him perform but had seen him at other people's gigs, so started following his Instagram. He does fantastic modular work and posts it on there via these minute-long videos. It's just little blips and cilps and I wish they were all records. He does Dublab performances – two hours of improvised music. For me, he's someone I've been listening to heavily and geeking out over. Records don't matter as much to him as one-minute video clips and then a monthly show, and that's really interesting. He's such a wonderful part of the LA electronic scene. Kinda like Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith who I love too. She's in the same realm","quote":"\"He's someone I've been geeking out over\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"Moon B","track":"","pickedBy":"Dam Funk","body":"He's from Atlanta but he's now living in Torrance in LA. His music is incredible, he's influenced by a lot of the same cats I like – Larry Heard, Prince, etc. He's played in my club Funkmosphere and always does innovative sets – the chords are lush and beautiful and it's not headbanging beats all the time, it's melodic. Those are the artists I love. The unique thing about his style is that the beats have an emotional feel but it's still something you can ride to, it has a dancefloor four-to-the-floor vibe to it. It's not the usual slap funk that's attached to the city of LA. It's his emotiveness that sets him apart from everything else in the funk / disco house scene right now.

He also won a Grammy for Beck's last album and was onstage at the ceremony with him, and he's the husband of Nite Jewel's Ramona Gonzalez. He helped mix Nite Jewel. He's a great cat and helps a lot of people on the LA scene – a silent helper. He mixed the NxWorries record on Stones Throw and the 7 Days Of Funk record that me and Snoop Dogg did together.

I first came across them many years ago, before they were Warpaint. They've been friends of mine since they were just friends playing music trying to think of a band name. In fact, I remember the day they said they were going with 'Warpaint' but it's vague in my mind it was so long ago. They're really incredible people and talented musicians in their own right. What I've seen them achieve over a relatively short period of time has made them what they've become now. It's so apparent on this new record [2016's 'Heads Up'] – they've proved that they're masters of atmosphere. They create this space that's very divine and you want to inhabit it forever. That's such a skill and I've seen them work at that. I'm in awe and so filled with wonder and respect for a band who in such a short period of time have achieved that. It's music for going to the beach at night, you know? The song 'Above Control' is my favourite on the new record; it's tremendously romantic and immediately immersive, you just want to stay in it. That's so difficult to create","quote":"\"They're masters of Atmosphere\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"Laura Steenberge","track":"","pickedBy":"Julia Holter","body":"I met Laura at CalArts and started singing with her in a little group. There's a way she deals with her environment and the objects around her that compels me. We throw away objects and don't repair things as much nowadays because we buy things cheap. There's a love of simple objects in her work. These days we're used to a lot of the same stuff but it's hard to find something that's fresh and crazy and that's Laura. She has this one piece where she's playing around with things in the room – pipes and tubes that inspired the more complex musical instruments that we have today. She sings through the pipes and makes musical recordings out of it, taking the history and imagining a time before the musical instrument was formed. She uses her voice too but she's not a trained singer so sings freely. She has this other piece called The Divine Comedy and uses the limits of the human voice to tell the story while also playing bass and the viola. She's screaming a lot while she's playing the bass. Laura explores human relationship to objects, getting down to the essence of why humans tell stories with their environment.

She also does a lot of great things with props. She pays a lot of attention to the environment too and tends to build crazy things onstage with whatever she can find. She's so powerful and has been doing this for a long time in LA and around the world. There's one LA Weekly article with the title 'At A Geneva Jacuzzi Show, You Might Get Smothered By A Giant Tentacle', ha! I've seen her perform in random clubs and in institutions like MOCA. At MOCA she had a huge thing she built and she was inside it – a big tent globe that she made out of fabric with air blowing through it to keep it up – and she was singing inside it. In random clubs she just finds whatever she can that's lying around and turns it into something crazy. She brought a load of fruit and vegetables onto the stage once and was throwing it at the audience, getting tomatoes everywhere. Usually she has a crazy outfit on but she was just wearing a windbreaker and it was equally stunning. She has an incredible presence and is such a star. Geneva definitely has a true vision","quote":"\"She just finds whatever is lying around and turns it into something crazy\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"Tyler, the creator","track":"","pickedBy":"Zane Lowe","body":"To me he is the absolute essential influencer of LA's modern music and art scene. There isn't anything that guy hasn't influenced. From the way Odd Future broke out, the DIY ethos, taking it viral, turning it into amazing records, and keeping that group together as long as they could, right through to launching his own Golf media, and Camp Flog Gnaw which must be one of the best new festivals of the past five years. Odd Future were fully transparent when they started, video-ing their lives and making music about it with no filter. They were the first thing I saw out of LA that made me feel the way I felt when I first saw Chocolate skateboards videos and early Spike Jonze. I first met him alongside Hodgy Beats, Syd Tha Kid and Left Brain. They were ripping the shit out of me, hassling my dress sense, my age, my accent. It was an analytical assassination and I fucking loved them for it. I knew straight away how smart Tyler was. I got to know him more over the years. His approach to the way he gets his music out and how he keeps it independent, he's just building culture around himself. He forges an inspiring individual train of thought. He's transformed into a businessman and built an incredible world around himself taking in media, fashion, live concerts and festivals, music, he's a director of his own videos… he's one of the most inspiring people to come out of LA in a very long time","quote":"\"He is the absolute essential influencer of LA's modern music scene\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"},{"artist":"Tobias Jesso Jr","track":"","pickedBy":"Zane Lowe","body":"Tobias is a timeless influence. There's something incredibly west coast about him even though he's not from here. The chords that he writes, his tone, the harmonies in his songs feel like an extension of Laurel Canyon. He's able to capture a melancholy that exists in this city as well. There's a lot of layers to LA and it's very dark at times. Tobias as a songwriter has become a behind the scenes go-to. Anyone who's out here trying to get the best songs they possibly can out of this Californian experience are writing with Tobias. He's always in the room. If Ariel Rechtshaid is the producer, Tobias is the songwriter and he's a connector. He's one of the best writers in the world right now and I'd be surprised if he's not the most in-demand songwriter in LA too. He captures that outsider mentality of arriving in a city and trying to make it. He could collaborate with anybody and add real amazing craft to that experience.

He was using basic equipment and developed his sound out of that restrictive environment. Within a year he'd won three Grammys and toured the world. He's the hardest working guy in music, more than anybody else but I feel like his presence is here always. Across music, clothing, the way that he spreads his word with posters around the city and his logo, everything about it feels guerrilla and it works. He's LA's modern mogul – a street-level success story. Even though he's gone onto become massively successful and built a huge business it still feels like he's existing at a very real level here. Sonny is versatile and open-minded towards collaboration too. He's an ideas guy and he thinks so fast he's constantly moving. He has such an incredible energy about him so when he meets someone collaboration is inevitable. Sonny is never really 'off'. He's always looking for people to partner up with. His label is working on cutting-edge dance music, and he's been successful in a very subversive way. If you think of the type of music that made him win awards it was considered by a lot of people as way too hard. He took more risks than he's given credit for.","quote":"\"He is the sound of downtown LA\"","platform":"","url":"","artistImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/1f1458ef7d6f01078e844a2eac3f3e9ef7d7d2da?crop=0_176_3238_4047","pickedByImage":"https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/acb2a1c16bdcc1d48ac49e109c4d91ad29c05571?crop=657_1563_1600_2000"}]}}
